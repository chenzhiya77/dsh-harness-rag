"""Patched ChatOpenAI that preserves thought_signature for Gemini thinking models.

When using Gemini with thinking enabled via an OpenAI-compatible gateway (e.g.
Vertex AI, Google AI Studio, or any proxy), the API requires that the
``thought_signature`` field on tool-call objects is echoed back verbatim in
every subsequent request.

The OpenAI-compatible gateway stores the raw tool-call dicts (including
``thought_signature``) in ``additional_kwargs["tool_calls"]``, but standard
``langchain_openai.ChatOpenAI`` only serialises the standard fields (``id``,
``type``, ``function``) into the outgoing payload, silently dropping the
signature.  That causes an HTTP 400 ``INVALID_ARGUMENT`` error:

    Unable to submit request because function call `<tool>` in the N. content
    block is missing a `thought_signature`.

This module fixes the problem by overriding ``_get_request_payload`` to
re-inject tool-call signatures back into the outgoing payload for any assistant
message that originally carried them.
